          The 21st century is demanding more from our schools. It's no longer enough graduating knowing just the "hard skills", like how to develop software or design products. Those best at work and life possess excellent "soft skills", like how to collaborate and communicate effectively in groups, a refined creative process, resilience in the face of failure, the ability to connect ideas from across academic disciplines. 
        </p>
        <p class="spaced">Our research-backed curriculum won't just teach you how to be a great software developer, but will give you skills that'll be invaluable in any career. We hope it will expand both your heart and your mind.</p>

            As with anything, becoming an expert takes time and dedication. Programming is no exception, but our expert teachers will guide you through both the age-old fundamentals, as well as cutting-edge technologies. This is no "get rich quick" scheme: after our intense course, you'll have a solid background in data representation, data structures, algorithms, product design, source control and agile development. At the end, you'll have a chance to do a deep dive into a particular technology through a self-designed project.
