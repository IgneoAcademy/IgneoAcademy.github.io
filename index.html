          Knowing how to code unlocks the world. Everywhere you look, the brightest innovators are using software to build their ideas, inspire action, and solve the world's toughest problems.

          <b>But coding know-how alone is not enough</b>. The leaders of today and tomorrow have more than "hard skills"—they also know how to collaborate in groups, harness their creativity, think globally and across disciplines, and show grit in the face of failure. Enter Igneo.

          We believe that the best learning happens in communities defined by <b>rigorous expectations, a culture of collaboration, and talented peers who inspire you to be your best</b>. Igneo creates such communities of world-class teachers and students, provides high quality instruction, and enables students to solve the problems that they're passionate about. School shouldn't be about jumping through hoops until graduation; it should nurture, challenge, and inspire.

          From little or no prior experience, we'll take you through the fundamentals of computer science, algorithmic problem-solving, and of course, writing efficient, working programs. But we also know that software development isn't just about writing good code, it's about applying computing principles to the real world. Every step of the way, we'll tie our learning to student-directed projects, so your learning has purpose. Gain the expertise to get hired—or better yet, to start your own company.

          We believe that school should be as much a reflection of "real life" as possible. The world doesn't need more excellent test takers—it needs more problem-solvers who are passionate about creating value, and have the expertise to make it happen. Igneo students have a calling to a higher cause: they're driven to use what they learn to make tangible impact. Our schooling environment reflects that drive.

          Creativity isn't a gift that's bestowed upon some and not others: research shows that like any skill, it can be honed over time. But doing so requires disciplined iteration, abandoning your fear of failure, embracing play, and working effectively with supportive teammates. The design process and culture at Igneo will unleash your creative potential.

          Learning so quickly is hard work, but extremely rewarding. We don't want finances to exclude anyone from the experience, so we're offering our course completely for free, and we'll give you a laptop, too. The catch? Students must commit their full time and effort to both the course and the internship.
